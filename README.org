![oro](~/.emacs.d/rurouni-kenshin-oro.jpg "Oro?")

This is my personal emacs configuration - it's currently a work in progress. I eventually intend for these set of configurations to be used by other people. 
Since people who create a set of configs name that set - I'll name mine. This is called Oro, after what the character Kenshin (from Rurouni Kenshin) says 
when he's confused. 

** Setup 
*** oro/
The core of Oro - this directory includes files that handle all of the core functionalities.

For me, I consider core functionalities to be better defaults and completion.

- oro-completion.el 

*** modules/
