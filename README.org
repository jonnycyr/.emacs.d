* Oro?

This is my personal emacs configuration - it's currently a work in progress. I eventually intend for these set of configurations to be used by other people. 
Since people who create a set of configs name that set - I'll name mine. 

This is called Oro, after what the character Kenshin (from Rurouni Kenshin) says when he's confused.

** Structure 
*** oro/
The core of Oro - this directory includes files that handle all of the core functionalities.

For me, I consider core functionalities to be better defaults and completion.

- oro-completion.el 

*** modules/
** Tasks 
*** TODO Fix the checker used for flycheck 
I'm currently running into an issue where flycheck defaults to using LSP as the syntax checker. I'd like to either:
- override flycheck so that is picks php-phpcs as the checker 
- or make it so that LSP is used, but flycheck only shows up after save and not within lsp-ui-line
*** TODO Fix deleting / pressing space lag 
Holding down backspace or space has a noticeable lag. I think this may have to do with lsp-ui-doc, where 
it's making calls to lsp-ui-doc between each backspace / space. 
*** TODO Speed up LSP or go back to ac-php 
I primarily program in PHP - lsp-php is nice but it isn't as fast as I would like it to be. I think I might 
try to make some modifications so that it's faster, or I'll go back to using ac-php. 
*** TODO Find a way to complete/order $this->
When typing $this-> or $class-> there are candidates from that classes scope within the company pop up. This 
is super helpful, but there are a couple of issues:
- I can only type $this->, if I try to do $this->a on occasion the completion stops working 
- Also, the candidates are not sorted as you type - so just doing $this-> will show all of whats available 
  in alphabetical order - but if you do $this->h it won't show things starting with h first 
*** TODO Find the best functions to use for jumping back and forth between definitions 
Evil provides evil jump to and going back, but so does xref (which LSP uses). Find the best one to use.
In addition, fix the keybindings so that they actually work!
*** TODO Think about committing a task archive 
It'd be interesting to keep track of a task archive for this readme file - so that I can see all the tasks I've 
completed regarding Oro.
*** TODO Adjust company-lsp 
company-lsp will complete on functions but for variables it shows a list of local available variables 
in alphabetical order, rather than order by what's closets to what I'm typing 
*** TODO Fix the key bindings in oro-php 
They currently do not work - I think I need to look into how keymaps work 
*** TODO Create a function that goes through the comments of each file 
And turns it into an org booklet! That way, people can view this source code as if they were 
reading a book. 
*** TODO Create a function that / write code that will strip comments from all .el files 
This is for people that want to have a starting configuration without all the extra talk.
*** TODO Create a function that compiles oro into one large org file
*** TODO Make it so that core is automatically downloaded but modules are only downloaded when used 
The rationalale behind this is the "core" is the essence of oro and is absolutely needed, while modules are optional
