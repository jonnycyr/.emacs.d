![oro](~/.emacs.d/rurouni-kenshin-oro.jpg "Oro?")

This is my personal emacs configuration - it's currently a work in progress. I eventually intend for these set of configurations to be used by other people. 
Since people who create a set of configs name that set - I'll name mine. This is called Oro, after what the character Kenshin (from Rurouni Kenshin) says 
when he's confused.
