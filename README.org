![oro](~/.emacs.d/rurouni-kenshin-oro.jpg "Oro?")

This is my personal emacs configuration - it's currently a work in progress. I eventually intend for these set of configurations to be used by other people. 
Since people who create a set of configs name that set - I'll name mine. This is called Oro, after what the character Kenshin (from Rurouni Kenshin) says 
when he's confused.
 
** Setup 
*** Settings up GNU Global and Universal-ctags 
The GNU Global package on Ubuntu is really old, it's best to grab a tar file from here: https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/global/

The exuberant-ctags package hasn't been worked on since 2009, so I use [[https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags][Universal-ctags]]. 

These instructions are meant for a Debian based system.

1. git clone https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags.git
2. If you have autoconfm automake, and pkg-config you can skip these steps, otherwise:
   1. sudo apt-get install autoconf
   2. sudo apt-get install automake
   3. sudo apt-get install pkg-config
3. cd into the ctags directory
4. Run the following (these steps are from the [[http://docs.ctags.io/en/latest/autotools.html][docs]] page):
   1. ./autogen.sh
   2. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bin
   3. make
   4. sudo make install
5. Grab a tar file from https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/global/
6. tar -xzvf global-<version_num>
7. cd into the global-<version_num> directory
8. If you do not have ncurses, run the following:
   1. sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
9. Run the following:
   1. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bin --with-universal-ctags=/usr/local/bin/ctags
   2. make
   3. sudo make install 

** Structure 
*** oro/
The core of Oro - this directory includes files that handle all of the core functionalities.

For me, I consider core functionalities to be better defaults and completion.

- oro-completion.el 

*** modules/
** Tasks 
*** TODO Fix the checker used for flycheck 
I'm currently running into an issue where flycheck defaults to using LSP as the syntax checker. I'd like to either:
- override flycheck so that is picks php-phpcs as the checker 
- or make it so that LSP is used, but flycheck only shows up after save and not within lsp-ui-line
*** TODO Fix deleting / pressing space lag 
Holding down backspace or space has a noticeable lag. I think this may have to do with lsp-ui-doc, where 
it's making calls to lsp-ui-doc between each backspace / space. 
*** TODO Speed up LSP or go back to ac-php 
I primarily program in PHP - lsp-php is nice but it isn't as fast as I would like it to be. I think I might 
try to make some modifications so that it's faster, or I'll go back to using ac-php. 
*** TODO Find a way to complete/order $this->
When typing $this-> or $class-> there are candidates from that classes scope within the company pop up. This 
is super helpful, but there are a couple of issues:
- I can only type $this->, if I try to do $this->a on occasion the completion stops working 
- Also, the candidates are not sorted as you type - so just doing $this-> will show all of whats available 
  in alphabetical order - but if you do $this->h it won't show things starting with h first 
*** TODO Find the best functions to use for jumping back and forth between definitions 
Evil provides evil jump to and going back, but so does xref (which LSP uses). Find the best one to use.
In addition, fix the keybindings so that they actually work!
*** TODO Think about committing a task archive 
It'd be interesting to keep track of a task archive for this readme file - so that I can see all the tasks I've 
completed regarding Oro.
*** TODO Adjust company-lsp 
company-lsp will complete on functions but for variables it shows a list of local available variables 
in alphabetical order, rather than order by what's closets to what I'm typing 
*** TODO Fix the key bindings in oro-php 
They currently do not work - I think I need to look into how keymaps work
